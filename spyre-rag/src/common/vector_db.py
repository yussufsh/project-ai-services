        Inserts document chunks and their corresponding embeddings into the vector database.

        This method is flexible to handles two workflows:
        1. If 'vectors' is provided, it uses those pre-computed embeddings directly.
        2. If 'vectors' is None but an 'embedding' instance is provided, it uses that
           instance to generate embeddings from the 'page_content' within the chunks.

        Args:
            chunks: A list of dictionaries containing text content and metadata.
            vectors: A list of pre-computed vector arrays.
            embedding: An instance of the Embedding class to generate vectors.

        Retrieves the top-k most relevant documents from the vector database.

        This method supports multiple search modes (Dense, Sparse, or Hybrid):
        1. If 'vector' is provided, it performs a direct k-NN similarity search.
        2. If 'vector' is None but an 'embedding' instance is provided, it first
           vectorizes the 'query_text' before performing the search.
        3. If using Hybrid mode, 'query_text' is also used for keyword (BM25) matching.

        Args:
            query_text: The natural language query string from the user.
            vector: A pre-computed query vector.
            embedding: An instance of the Embedding class to vectorize the query.
            top_k: The number of similar documents to return.
